# College-Debt---Model-Selection
Clean data, build multiple models, and select the best.

The project starts with exploratory analysis. Then it moves into model building, where a function was written to implement a best subset approach to model selection. The results of the model building was plotted and a best model was chosen. The residuals of the final model are assessed and interaction terms are visually inspected.
